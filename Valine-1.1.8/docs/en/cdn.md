# CDN
Recommended: [unpkg](//unpkg.com), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm.

## Latest version

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
```

## Specific version

If you are concerned about the frequent version of the update may have unknown Bug, we can also use the specific version.

> Rule: `//unpkg.com/valine@VERSION/dist/Valine.min.js`

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/valine@1.1.7/dist/Valine.min.js"></script>
```

!> Specify *VERSION* for `latest` to force the latest version to be requested each time.
